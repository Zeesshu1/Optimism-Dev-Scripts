# 🐍 Optimism Python Tools

## ✨ Overview

This repository features a collection of Python scripts designed to facilitate interaction with the **Optimism (OP)** Layer 2 network. Utilizing the `web3.py` library, these tools enable you to easily read on-chain data, track network statistics, and serve as a foundation for building more complex dApps or automation scripts.

This toolset provides a solid starting point for data processing, analysis, and automation tasks on Optimism L2.
